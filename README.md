🤖 A humorous discovery about Cursor's AI documentation assistant

## The Story

On a website that has an AI assistant, you would assume that they have some measures in place to prevent you from just asking it the most random unrelated things regarding the specific documentation it is supposed to be helping you with.

In this case on Cursor's website, I decided to see if their AI helper would just make me a website... **And it was more than happy in doing so!**

Funny enough, you can actually get more usage limits from using their own AI doc helper rather than using Claude for free!

## The Irony

- **Expected:** AI doc helper assists with understanding Cursor documentation
- **Reality:** AI doc helper becomes a free full-stack developer
